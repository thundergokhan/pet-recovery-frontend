# Pet Recovery Project - Frontend

The aim of this project is to help earthquake victims find their lost pets. Therefore, a system with the following features needs to be designed:

- Form for pet owners to input information about their lost pet: Pet owners should be able to enter information about their lost pet, such as pictures, names, genders, ages, breeds, and other information.

- Storage of found pet information: The system should store the information entered by pet owners and make it accessible to other users.

- Pet search function: The system should match found pet information with the information and pictures of lost pets.

- Tracking of adoption process: The system should track the information about pet owners adopting or finding their pet.

These features are the basic features of the project and can be defined in more detail during the coding process.

This is a web page defined as a pet finding platform. Users can provide information about lost pets and can send photos and information about their pets by filling out a form. Some of the fields in the form include:

- Name of your pet
- Type
- Gender
- Age
- Photo
- Details

Users can specify the types of their pets by selecting the "Other" option and specifying with an additional text field. Users can choose between "Male" and "Female" options for gender. After entering the age of the pet, users can add additional details about their pet. After filling out the form, users can submit it by clicking the "Submit" button or reset it by clicking the "Reset" button.
